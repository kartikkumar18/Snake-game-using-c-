# Snake-game-using-c-
The Snake Game project in C++ involves developing a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to collect food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with walls and itself. The game will be implemented using C++ and a graphics library like SFML. Key features include snake movement, random food generation, collision detection, score tracking, and a game over screen. The project will involve setting up the development environment, designing the game structure, implementing core mechanics, and ensuring smooth gameplay through a continuous game loop. Optional enhancements such as sound effects can be added to enhance the gaming experience.
